# Web Scrapping, Image-Processing and Data Visualization of Street Figther V 

I love Street Figther and currently I have a ideia to make some analisys with the information of this game, so I used data of the two official sites, your linksare here:

https://streetfighter.com/characters/
https://game.capcom.com/cfn/sfv/character/

To get the data I used techniques of Web Scrapping and Image-Processing, let's see an example of how this was done.
First of all I listed links of characters data, in the total there are 40 figthers in recent game, after that I used the list of characters in a loop to get the images from the site. Basically the image contain height, weight in text and a bar plot to represent range, power, health, mobility, techniques and range below we have a example:

With the packages imager I got select and extract the text of image and the size of each bar of the bar plot, to do that I use the functions highlight and isoblur, the code can be seen here

In the second step, I did a simple Web Scrapping using rvest to get some additional information like stun bar, number of moviments and online rank, we can see an example of the information in the image below highlighted in blue
